# reTime-game
A dystopian dialectical VR game that showcases the universe's creation and human development through the millennia's through a trip in outer space and then revisiting what life on earth could be if we were to be better. The user will then talk to Sill an interdimensional being who would help the player unravel solutions to current dilemmas.
